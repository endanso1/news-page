          <h3>Let’s honour peace pact and commit to upholding unity, democratic maturity – CIMG to electorates</h3>
          <p>
            The Chartered Institute of Marketing Ghana (CIMG) is urging every Ghanaian to honour the peace pact signed by the 12 presidential candidates a few days ago, and to commit to upholding the peace, unity, and democratic maturity that make Ghana a shining example on the African continent.
            t therefore wants Ghanaians to approach the elections with respect, tolerance, and civility, ensuring that Ghana remains a beacon of hope and stability.Speaking at the 33rd Presidential Ball, President of CIMG, Dr. Daniel Kasser-Tee said “together, we can prove that our democracy is not just about voting but about building bridges of understanding and fostering a culture of mutual respect”.“If, not for anything at all, we should always remember that going to the polls to elect our leaders is something we have proudly done eight times in a row, in a little over three decades”, he added. Speaking on the theme “Harnessing the Power of AI as a Transformative Tool for Marketers," Dr. Kasser-Tee said Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal force, reshaping the way businesses connect with consumers, analyse data, and develop strategies and therefore it offers unparalleled opportunities to gain deep insights, enhance efficiency, and deliver personalised experiences that resonate with the audience.

          <h3>Ex-Black Stars player Samuel Inkoom faces court over alleged visa fraud </h3>
          <p>
            Samuel Inkoom, a former Black Stars player, has been charged with defrauding by false pretences in an Accra Circuit Court.The 34-year-old is accused of collecting $3,500 from Benjamin Opare Addo, a student, to secure a visa for travel to the Netherlands but failed to deliver on the promise. 

            Inkoom pleaded not guilty to the charges before the court, which was presided over by Mr. Isaac Addo.  
            
            He was granted bail in the amount of GH¢50,000 with one surety and is set to return to court on December 30, 2024. 
            
            In his defence, Inkoom’s lawyer argued for bail, citing that the accused had refunded GH¢7,000 and was making efforts to return the remaining balance of GH¢25,100.  According to the prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Jonas Lawer, Inkoom, who claimed to be the owner of S. Inkoom Travel and Tour Company, convinced Addo in September 2023 that he could secure a visa to the Netherlands for a fee of $3,500.  

            Between September and November 2023, Addo paid a total of GH¢32,100 in instalments. 
            
            The court heard that Inkoom failed to deliver the promised visa within the agreed timeframe and, after repeated unsuccessful attempts by Addo to recover his money or obtain the visa, the matter was reported to the police. Inkoom was arrested on January 11, 2024, and admitted to the offence, refunding GH¢7,000 but failing to return the remaining GH¢25,100.

          <h3>Fire devastates 3-storey KNUST student hostel, leaving students stranded</h3>
          <p>
            On Thursday night, a devastating fire razed a three-storey accommodation facility known as “Father Hostel” at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST).
            The cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but it has severely damaged the building, which served as a hostel for students.

At least nine rooms have been reduced to rubble, leaving the victims devastated and students in adjacent buildings frightened.

Fortunately, no casualties were reported. However, at least nine students have lost all their belongings to the flames, leaving them without a place to stay. 

Victims recounted that the fire started in a single room before it quickly spread throughout the building, consuming their valuables within minutes.Eyewitnesses noted that the KNUST Fire Department’s emergency number was initially unreachable, causing a delay of 30 minutes before they could respond to the incident.

The remaining portion of the building is deemed uninhabitable due to significant structural damage. 

In response, the KNUST Students' Representative Council (SRC) has arranged temporary accommodation for the affected students at the SRC hostel. 

The council is also urging all students to adhere to safety protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.

          <h3>Ghanaian passports now chip-embedded – Foreign Affairs Ministry</h3>
          <p>
            The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration has announced plans to upgrade from biometric passports to new chip-embedded documents.According to the Sector Minister, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, this initiative reflects a sincere commitment to efficiency, security, and compliance with international standards.

            “While the current biometric passport has served us steadfastly for over a decade, the demands of a fast-paced technological evolution have necessitated this upgrade. As the gateway to Africa, Ghana must remain at the forefront of growth and development by implementing novel technological developments in security documents taking into account new international standards, threats, and growth prospects.”
            
            Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, speaking at a ceremony held at the Accra International Conference Center to launch the enhanced travel document, described the introduction of the chip-embedded passport as a "major milestone" in Ghana’s digitization agenda. She emphasized that the new features were carefully designed to enhance security and facilitate ease of travel for Ghanaian citizens.
            
            The new travel document includes a microprocessor that stores the holder’s biometric and photo information, along with unique security features such as anti-fraud measures and both latent and patent indicators“By the introduction of the chip-embedded passport, Ghana is poised to be at the forefront of modern technology within the African sub-region, shortening the turn-around time for passport issuance, while making travel safer, and more secure for all citizens,” the minister added to ensure unimpeachable security.
