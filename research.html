          <h3>Tackling the Learning Crisis: Data-Driven Decision-Making in Ghana's Education System</h3>
          <p>
            In the bustling corridors of Ghana's schools, a quiet innovation is taking root—one driven by data, collaboration, and a shared commitment to transform education for every child. At the heart of this transformation lies the 'Differentiated Learning Plus (DL+) Dashboard,' a pioneering initiative that is reshaping the way student, teacher, and community data are collected, analyzed, and utilized.

Globally, the learning crisis is stark with 70 per cent of children in low- and middle-income countries cannot read and understand a simple text by age 10. In Ghana, 80 per cent of children still do not acquire basic skills in literacy and numeracy by the end of primary school.

Ghana’s DL+ programme, supported by UNICEF and the Gates Foundation, aims to address this learning crisis through the evidence-based Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, which tailors instruction to each student's ability level rather than age. The DL+ programme is being implemented in Grades 2 to 6 across 501 schools, with plans to expand to all 10,000 primary schools in Ghana in coming years.UNICEF in collaboration with the Government of Ghana and its key education agencies, endeavored to develop an all-encompassing tool that would consolidate assessment data, provide real-time insights, and empower stakeholders at all levels to make data-driven decisions. Government ownership and development were integral from the beginning, ensuring alignment with national education priorities.

Drawing on local expertise and global best practices, the dashboard is the locally grown solution provided by a passionate and innovative ICT statistics coordinator at the sub regional level. It was designed to align with Ghana's education priorities locally while incorporating key indicators that would allow Ghana to measure its progress in addressing the learning crisis against global targets. This solution was recognized at the national level to be a pathway to access authentic data that could be used for decision making. Its user-friendly interface and customizable features ensured accessibility for educators, policymakers, and community leaders alike.

          <h3>Ghana’s informal settlements are not all the same – social networks make a difference in community development</h3>
          <p>
            Informal settlements in Africa are diverse. Across regions and even in the same city, socioeconomic and physical conditions vary. One thing is common though: upgrading them is a challenge.

Among the challenges are issues of including people, having enough funding and sustaining improvements. That’s why attention is shifting to community driven development. This concept refers to local interventions that are started or led by community groups with support from the local government, private or civil society organisations.

Community driven development has gained support from international agencies such as the World Bank. The World Bank Group is estimated to have invested about US$30 billion in projects like this across 94 countries.

These initiatives are considered more affordable, efficient and durable. Communities often contribute local resources and labour, and residents can learn skills from service providers which enable them to manage projects in the long term. When residents work together it can also strengthen bonds and build social capital. Social capital generally refers to the ties, bonds, relationships and trust found in a community. It is an important resource in informal settlements.

We are a group of urban and development planners who examined the role of social capital in community driven development in urban Ghana.

We conducted our study in the Abese Quarter (La township) and Old Tulaku communities, in the Greater Accra metropolitan area. These are both informal settlements but have different social characters.

Our findings highlight the need for local governments to tailor development to the social context of informal settlements. Development planning institutions should use the networks already present in communities, as well as providing external help and resources.

The research
Our analysis was based on questionnaire responses from 300 residents of informal settlements in Greater Accra. Abese Quarter is what we call an indigenous settlement. It it composed of residents from the local Ga ethnic group with similar cultural practices. Old Tulaku is a migrant settlement. It includes a mix of residents originally from other regions in Ghana who moved to Accra in search of economic opportunities.

We observed community water and sanitation projects planned and carried out by local residents.

In doing so, we considered the role of two types of social capital: bonding and bridging.

Bonding social capital deals with the personal relationships between individuals based on shared identity. It’s about family, close companionship, culture and ethnicity. Bridging social capital refers to the connection between people and external groups.

In the indigenous settlement, bonding social capital had a positive influence on community driven development. Bridging social capital showed a negative relationship with it. For example, the public toilet in the community was in a deplorable state. This seemed to be explained by an inability to build wider connections outside the community to get the support needed. We reason that socially homogeneous communities tend to generate inward-looking networks that limit access to resources from beyond the group. Overemphasis on social ties can impede long-term community development.

In the migrant informal settlement, our research revealed the opposite. Without shared identities (like ethnicity, language and social norms), migrant residents drew on shared challenges and goals. They organised and built connections to get support from businesses and donors for community projects.

Our research reinforces the argument that the relationship between social capital and community-driven development of informal settlements is not straightforward. The social character of the settlement, be it indigenous or migrant, produces different outcomes.

          <h3>Ghana's Cybersecurity Journey: Confronting the Challenges of a Multi-Layered Defense</h3>
          <p>
            In the heart of Ghana's bustling digital transformation lies a story of ambition, innovation, and resilience. A nation rich in culture and resources, Ghana is also carving its place as a digital powerhouse. The growing adoption of technology in finance, healthcare, governance, and education has brought about immense opportunities—but also unforeseen challenges.

As the sun rises over Accra, a young fintech entrepreneur finalizes a deal with international investors. Her business, built on the backbone of Ghana's digital infrastructure, promises to revolutionize mobile money services. Yet, as she celebrates this victory, lurking in the shadows is a growing threat—a sophisticated network of cybercriminals watching for vulnerabilities to exploit. She is not alone in her concerns; from small businesses in Kumasi to government agencies in Tamale, the urgency of securing Ghana's cyberspace is palpable.

The evolution of Ghana's cybersecurity journey is not without its hurdles. Awareness among the population remains a significant challenge. In many parts of the country, people unknowingly click on phishing emails or share sensitive information on unsecured platforms. For many Ghanaians, cybersecurity is an abstract concept—a distant concern that does not affect their daily lives until it is too late.

Meanwhile, in a small office in Accra, a team of cybersecurity professionals works tirelessly. They monitor potential threats, ensuring that hackers cannot breach critical systems. Despite their expertise, they face a daunting reality: the sophistication of attacks is increasing. Organized crime groups and even nation-states are testing Ghana’s defenses, targeting everything from banking systems to national records.

The struggle is compounded by the lack of skilled professionals in the field. Universities across the country are only now beginning to introduce specialized programs in cybersecurity, but the gap between demand and supply remains significant. It is not just about having enough hands on deck—it’s about ensuring those hands have the right training and tools to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.

The introduction of Ghana's Cybersecurity Act 2020 was a defining moment. The Cyber Security Authority (CSA) was established to bring order to the chaos. Through this institution, Ghana began to lay the groundwork for a national strategy that prioritized security, resilience, and public awareness. Campaigns were launched to educate citizens on topics like securing passwords and recognizing scams. The nation began to dream of a future where every citizen, from market traders to CEOs, understood the importance of cyber hygiene.

However, even with policy in place, the battle is far from over. The issue of data privacy looms large. Companies collecting and storing user information struggle to comply with regulations, while citizens remain unsure of how their data is being used. In rural communities, the challenge is even greater. With limited access to resources, individuals in these areas remain the most vulnerable to cyber threats.

But hope is not lost. There are stories of collaboration and triumph. In Tema, a group of university students develops a groundbreaking app that uses blockchain to secure digital transactions. In Cape Coast, a government-backed initiative trains women in cybersecurity, creating a new generation of experts to lead the fight against cybercrime. Across the nation, partnerships with international organizations bring advanced technology and expertise to Ghana’s shores, enabling the country to keep pace with global standards.

The future of Ghana’s cybersecurity lies in a multi-layered defense—one that protects individuals, businesses, and government institutions alike. This journey is not just about creating firewalls and encryptions; it is about fostering a culture of resilience. It is about ensuring that every Ghanaian, whether in a high-rise office in Accra or a small farming community in the north, has the tools and knowledge to navigate the digital world safely.

As Ghana confronts these challenges head-on, the nation proves that resilience is embedded in its DNA. The journey is far from over, but every step forward is a testament to the determination and ingenuity of its people. The story of Ghana’s cybersecurity journey is not just one of defense—it is a story of transformation, a narrative of a nation rising to meet the demands of a digital era.
